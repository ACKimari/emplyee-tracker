# emplyee-tracker
An application that allows you to keep track of your Employees.

## Description
This project was fun and a bit complicated at first. However, once I was able to get the first parts working I instantly knew what to do after. My motivation was seeing it working. Therefore, this pushed me to complete the tasks.

I faced difficulty in getting the right code to link my tables in the add and update instances, however, I was able to get my code to show the tables when prompted.

## Installation
Step 1: Ceate a repo in Github, clone it and code it on VSCode starting with the sequel database folder creation. This file should contain schema.sql and seeds.sql, the query,sql file isn't necessary but saves a lot of time when in need of code that allows you to view your tables accordingly.

Step 2: Next, create an index.js file.

Step 3: Begin your codes within the sequel folder and once all your tables are running with no errors, begin working on your index.js file.

Step 4: Your index.js file will allow you to complete your tasks including, adding attributes to your tables, viewing your tables and updating your tables.

Step 5: Before you begin your index.js file, install the following: npm init, npm i, npm i inquirer(for prompts), npm i mysql2(to link your mysql) and npm i console.table.
